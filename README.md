# Python-tensorflow-oneDNN
To build the predictive model, participants will be required to use oneAPI libraries such as oneDNN (Deep Neural Network Library), which will enable efficient training and inference on a variety of hardware platforms.

Dataset Preparation: Collect a dataset of images for a particular classification task, such as recognizing different types of flowers.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images by resizing them to a fixed size and normalizing the pixel values.

Model Selection: Choose a deep neural network model architecture that is suitable for the classification task, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Model Training: Use OneDNN to train the model on the preprocessed dataset. Using Python and TensorFlow.
