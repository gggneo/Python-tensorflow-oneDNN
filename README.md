# Python-tensorflow-oneDNN
To build the predictive model, participants will be required to use oneAPI libraries such as oneDNN (Deep Neural Network Library), which will enable efficient training and inference on a variety of hardware platforms.

Dataset Preparation: Collect a dataset of images for a particular classification task, such as recognizing different types of flowers.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images by resizing them to a fixed size and normalizing the pixel values.

Model Selection: Choose a deep neural network model architecture that is suitable for the classification task, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Model Training: Use OneDNN to train the model on the preprocessed dataset. Using Python and the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit to train a machine learning model on a preprocessed dataset using the oneDNN library.

Predicting Consumer Sentiment
Problem Statement:
Businesses can use consumer sentiment to know their customers and improve their sales by
formulating a strategy adopting the consumer reactions towards the different types of content .
By understanding consumer sentiment, they can tailor their messaging and advertising to
appeal to their target audience.
In this hackathon, participants are tasked with building a predictive model that can analyze
social media activity to determine consumer sentiment towards a particular content. The model
should take into account various features of the social media data, such as the latest news,
resources, topic of the media resources, popularity on the social media.
Task:
The goal of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can predict consumer
sentiment towards the different types of content based on social media activity and optimize it
using oneAPI libraries
To build the predictive model, participants can use Intel® Optimized Frameworks and Intel®
oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit and Libraries such as oneDNN(Deep Neural Network Library),
oneMKL(Math Kernel Library) etc. which will enable efficient training and inference on a variety
of hardware platforms.
Note: It is mandatory to use the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit and Libraries for the solution.
Leverage the libraries and optimizations for the maximum efficiency and better models.
You can explore the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit and Libraries to find the related libraries
and optimizations for improving performance which will make your solution stand-out. Some of
